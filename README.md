# PathFinder - IEUK 22 work sample
Task description: [Amazon Coding Exercise - Pathfinding on a 2D Grid.pdf](https://github.com/kda16/PathFinder/files/8956526/Amazon.Coding.Exercise.-.Pathfinding.on.a.2D.Grid.pdf) <br>
Implemented [Lee algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_algorithm) based on Breadth-First Search. <br>

### Ideas for further development:
1. Fix bugs when maze's dimensions increased
2. Solve the <b> "bonus" </b> part: <br>
> In the event that your vehicle is unable to reach its destionation, your algorithm should print "unable to reach delivery point" and identify which obstacles to be removed in order for the vehicle to reach its destionation.<br> <br>
> Your algorithm should suggest the least amount of obstacles using the format [(x1,y1,(x2,y2)....] in order for your vehicle to reach its destination.
3. Implement other algorithms: [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), [D*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D*) <br>
4. Showcase the differences between the algorithms similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3x7BlLgS-4) <br>
